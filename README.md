# 👋 Hi, I’m Bello Usman Abdullah (@engrusmanbelloa)

**Web3 Infrastructure Engineer (EVM / Middleware)**  
TypeScript • Next.js • Solidity • Foundry • Web3 SDKs

## 🚀 About Me

I’m a **product-minded Web3 Infrastructure Engineer** with hands-on experience building **middleware, automation systems, and developer-facing tools** on EVM-compatible blockchains.

My work focuses on **abstracting Web3 complexity** — wallet integrations, transaction lifecycles, gas handling, onboarding, and access control — so developers and users can interact with decentralized systems more easily and safely.

Alongside engineering, I’m completing **MSc-level research in Telecommunications Engineering**, with a focus on **cryptography, post-quantum security, and blockchain consensus**, bridging real-world infrastructure performance with long-term protocol security.
